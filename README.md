# GestureSense-
Designed a real-time hand gesture recognition system using adaptive thresholding, contour detection, convex hulls, and cosine rules. Forgoing deep learning, it delivers fast, accurate finger counting with live annotations â€” proving classical vision can rival complexity when crafted with precision and purpose.
